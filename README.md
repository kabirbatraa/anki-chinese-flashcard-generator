# anki-chinese-flashcard-generator

Wrote a javascript flashcard template that uses the HanziWriter javascript library to render Chinese flashcards with stroke order.
Wrote a python script that parses a vocab list text file, downloads HanziWriter stroke order data, and converts it all into a format that my flashcard template understands.
